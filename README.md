this is my Nanodegree would you rather project, the second project in react nanodegree program  


In the project directory, you can run:

npm install
Runs this to install all the project dependencies

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

For reference, this project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
